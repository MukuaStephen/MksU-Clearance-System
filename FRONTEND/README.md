# Machakos University — Graduation Clearance Frontend (Mock)

This is a lightweight React frontend (Vite) mock that demonstrates a digital graduation clearance workflow for Machakos University. It uses an in-memory `mockApi` to simulate payments and departmental approvals.

## Install & Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` (Vite default) to view the app.

## Structure
- `src/components` — React components for student and admin interfaces
- `src/services/mockApi.js` — in-memory mock API

This is frontend-only and intentionally mocks backend operations. Ask me to add real API hooks, authentication, or routing next.
